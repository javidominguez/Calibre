 An NVDA add-on with some accessibility enhancements for the interface of Calibre eBook Management

* F12 search the current book in Google
* NVDA+Alt+End says the total of books in the current library view and the number of books selected
* NVDA+Control+H open the context menu for settings of the current column
* I in library view reads the book information.
 
Keystrokes can be customized in  Preferences  of NVDA > Input gestures when calibre are open. Also you can define in preferences the way NVDA reads the table headers  in the library (rows and columns, columns only or none).
